# basic-html-material-start
Personal prupose project. But feel free to use it!

# Getting started

## Cloning the project
First, open a `Terminal`, then enter:

`git clone https://github.com/lgabrielgomez/basic-html-material-start`.

This will create a directory called `basic-html-material-start`. Inside, you'll find the repository

## Enjoy!
There's nothing more to do here. You can start templating with MaterializeCSS!

PD: You have a `baseLayout.html` file, I think it's useful when adding pages to your web template. It includes all the needed `scripts` and `css`.
